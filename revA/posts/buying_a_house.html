<p>EDIT: My wife pointed out a few things to me that needed to be added/changed in the post.  I updated the costs of travel - I messed up the math pretty bad.  Second, I added a few other things that I had no added that I think are important to know.  I added it under the <strong>Other Things You'll Need</strong> section at the end.</p>

</br>

<p>A good friend of mine has been thinking of buying a house for some time now.  My wife and I purchased our house in 2010 from Faber Builders - we built it new.  Owning a home is an absolutely amazing experience, and for many, a life goal.</p>

<p>While my wife and I were looking at houses (which, admittedly we didn't not look at many), we were at a bit of a loss for how the money aspect of the whole thing works.  After the fact, our total out-of-pocket cost was quite a bit higher than we anticipated (although thankfully still within our budget).</p>

<p>I thought I would take a moment to go through some numbers to show where some of the hidden costs in the house buying process.</p>

<h3>The Parts</h3>

<p>There are a number of different 'cost buckets' that go into owning a home.  Here are the big ones that I have identified in my experience as a home owner:</p>

<ul>
<li>Loan Payment
<ul><li>made up of interest and principle payments</li></ul></li>
<li>Taxes
<ul><li>made up of local, county, and state taxes</li></ul></li>
<li>Improvement Costs
<ul><li>'I think I want this room to be dark red rather than white'</li>
<li>'Sweetheart, We got a warning in the mail because we haven't mowed our lawn in 5 weeks ...'</li></ul></li>
<li>Home repair
<ul><li>'Honey, why isn't there any hot water?'</li></ul></li>
<li>Utilities
<ul><li>'I just can't seem to keep the house warm ... aaaand there is no insulation in the wall' (see: home repair)</li></ul></li>
<li>Travel Costs
<ul><li>You might find your dream house, but if it's 40 miles from where you work, you could be spending a small fortune on gas (unless you have one of those fancy electric cars and your work lets you plug it in during the day, ha)</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Mortgage Costs</h3>

<p>First, let's take a look at the equation that is used to calculate the monthly payment to the bank for paying the loan off.</p>

<pre><code>P = L[c(1 + c)n]/[(1 + c)n - 1]

Where P = monthly payment
      L = Loan amount in dollars
      c = calculated interest value (c = APR%/12)
      n = Term in months
</code></pre>

<p>Credit: the above was taken from <a href="http://www.mtgprofessor.com/formulas.htm">MTGProfessor</a> - great site, do recommend.</p>

<p>This equation tells us what our monthly payment is - awesome, we need that!  let's look at some possible house costs.  You can see the Google Drive document I put together <a href="http://bit.ly/1dxcYfV">here</a>.</p>

<p>I used 5% down payment (First Time Homebuyer (FHA) loans require 3.5%, 'traditional' loans usually require closer to 20%), and an interest rate of 4% (about what it is today).  The term (length) of the loan is 30 years (pretty typical for your first house).</p>

<pre><code>$50,000.00  = $226.77/mo.
$75,000.00  = $340.16/mo.
$100,000.00 = $453.54/mo.
$125,000.00 = $566.93/mo.
$150,000.00 = $680.32/mo.
$175,000.00 = $793.70/mo.
$200,000.00 = $907.09/mo.
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, that gives us a pretty good spread!  let's assume we are going to purchase a $150,000 house (pretty nice, eh!).  That means that our principle and interest per month is $680.32/month - not too bad.</p>

<p>Since we haven't paid off 20% of our value yet, we need to carry mortgage insurance.  I used <a href="http://www.goodmortgage.com/Calculators/PMI.html">this</a> calculated and pluged in our $150,000 value, then our loan amount minus 5% of $142,500, and a interest rate of 4%.  This produce a monthly PMI cost of $85.50 until you get to 20% of the principle paid off (this will be around the 10 year mark).</p>

<h3>Taxes</h3>

<p>Of the 'cost buckets' I mentioned above, really are only three of them that we can calculate: mortgage payment, taxes, fuel costs, and utilities.  So let's calculate them.</p>

<p>I live in Henrietta, NY where taxes are some of (may actually be the lowest) in the state.  That wasn't a factor in buying the house, but it certainly is nice!</p>

<p>There are a LOT of entities that tax you - like, a WAY lot.  The big ones are:</p>

<ul>
<li>School District
<ul><li>If you do not have kids, you can fill out a 'STAR exemption' that will reduce your payment by $500/year.</li></ul></li>
<li>Town</li>
<li>County</li>
<li>State</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these entities calculate the amount of tax you pay them by a percentage of how much your house is worth, or a dollar amount per $1,000 assessed.  We can use this cheat sheet <a href="http://www.tax.ny.gov/research/property/reports/fvtaxrates/overall_county_12.htm">here</a>.  Monroe County is $40.10/$1,000 for 2012 (although, as you can see, is trending upward).
  - $150,000 / $1,000 * $40.10 / 12 months = $501.25/mo.</p>

<p>So our (approximate) tax cost is $501.25/mo.  So our total cost per month is up to $1181.57.  Since this is based off of the estimate via that link above, I think we'll make this just $1180 and assume a +/- $100 error.  It wasn't immediately apparent to me if school taxes were included in the $501.25/mo. so I think we should add them.</p>

<p>The rate of $40.10 does match up with what I pay in taxes each year, so I am taking that as an estimate, but one with a high confidence.</p>

<h3>Fuel Costs</h3>

<p>Okay, that leaves us with fuel costs.  Let's say you live 5 miles from work, so that's 10 miles a day, five days a week for 50 weeks of the year.That is 2500 miles a year.  At $3.50 a gallon (approximate cost at the time of this blog post), and your car gets 25 miles/gallon on average, that is a cost of $350/year, or $29.16/mo. - not too bad.</p>

<p>Let's, for a moment, say you live 30 miles from work.  30mi. * 2/day * 5days/week * 50weeks/year / 25mpg * $3.50/gal / 12mo/year = $175/mo.  let's say your car gets closer to 18mpg - that results in $243.05/mo.  For this example, let's use the 30 miles at 25mpg, or $175/mo.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have Utilities.  This can vary quite a bit, but let's look at an estimate:</p>

<pre><code>RG&amp;E (gas and electric): $100/mo.
Cable+Internet: $120/mo.
Trash: $20/mo.
</code></pre>

<p>Those values are assuming light electrical usage (turning off the TV and computer when you are not using them, turning off the light when  you leave the room), no central air, and a basic cable, internet, and phone package.  Your town may have trash pick-up, mine does not.</p>

<h3>The Totals</h3>

<p>The total monthly cost that we have calculated/estimated comes to:</p>

<pre><code>House Value: $150,000
Down Payment: $7500 (5%)
Interest Rate: 4%

Mortgage: $680.32/mo.
PMI: $85.50/mo.
Taxes: $501.25/mo.
Fuel: $175.00/mo.
Utilities: $240.00/mo.
----
Total: $1,682.07/mo.
</code></pre>

<p>That's a lot of money, but well worth it if you have the dream of being a home owner.  Feel free to use these numbers to plug in your own values and see how much house you can buy.  If I have some more time this evening, I'll try and put together a calculator for Monroe County.</p>

<h3>Other Things You'll Need</h3>

<p>My wife pointed out to me that there are a few other things that you will need when trying to get a mortgage for your house.  The bank usually wants to see bank statements and credit card statements.  This helps them identify if you are living paycheck-to-paycheck or are able to save money.</p>

<p>It's important to the bank to know that you have enough money in savings to fix anything that breaks in <em>their</em> investment.  They want to try and determine if you are the type of person that will prevent their investment (your house) from declining in value below what they can sell it for.</p>
