<p>Today is Election day, November 5th, 2013.  After I spent most of the day out by Buffalo, NY I headed over to the community center near my house to vote.  My wife and I had spent some time last night looking over the various documents that were provided by the Monroe County Election Board.  We did so in an attempt to become more familiar with the various candidates as well as any propositions that we would see on the ballet.  After some digging these are the documents we came up with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The complete list of all people currently in office:

<li><p>A sample ballet for my voting location:

<p>We weren't able to find <em>that</em> much information about any particular candidate, but I did link their personal page, a youtube video, or a linkedin page for each candidate.</p>

<h2>Propositions</h2>

<p><strong>Authorizing Casino Gaming</strong>
The proposed amendment to section 9 of article 1 of the Constitution would allow
the Legislature to authorize up to seven casinos in New York State for the
legislated purposes of promoting job growth, increasing aid to schools, and
permitting local governments to lower property taxes through revenues generated.
Shall the amendment be approved?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some various documents that assisted me in learning more:</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Exclusion of Indebtedness Contracted for Sewage Facilities</strong>
The proposed amendment to Article 8, section 5 of the Constitution would extend
for ten years, until January 1, 2024, the authority of counties, cities, towns, and
villages to exclude from their constitutional debt limits indebtedness contracted for
the construction or reconstruction of sewage facilities. Shall the proposed</p>

<p><strong>Settling Disputed Title in the Forest Preserve</strong>
The proposed amendment to section 1 of article 14 of the
Constitution would authorize the Legislature to settle longstanding
disputes between the State and private entities over ownership of
certain parcels of land in the town of Long Lake, Hamilton County. In
exchange for giving up its claim to disputed parcels, the State would
get land to be incorporated into the forest preserve that would benefit
the forest preserve more than the disputed parcels currently do.</p>

<p><strong>In Relation to a Land Exchange in the State Forest Preserve with NYCO Minerals, Inc.</strong>
The proposed amendment to section 1 of article 14 of the Constitution would authorize
the Legislature to convey forest preserve land located in the town of Lewis, Essex
County, to NYCO Minerals, a private company that plans on expanding an existing
mine that adjoins the forest preserve land. In exchange, NYCO Minerals would give
the State at least the same amount of land of at least the same value, with a minimum
assessed value of $1 million, to be added to the forest preserve. When NYCO Minerals
finishes mining, it would restore the condition of the land and return it to the forest</p>

<p><strong>Increasing Age until which Certain State Judges Can Serve</strong>
The proposed amendment to the Constitution, amending sections 2 and 25 of article 6,
would increase the maximum age until which certain state judges may serve as follows: (a)
a Justice of the Supreme Court would be eligible for five additional two-year terms after the present retirement age of 70, instead of the three such terms currently authorized; and (b) a Judge of the Court of Appeals who reaches the age of 70 while in office would be permitted to remain in service on the Court for up to 10 years beyond the present retirement age of 70 in order to complete the term to which that Judge was appointed. Shall the proposed</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>I wanted to be able to review the various proposals and candidates before voting, since going in blind seemed ridiculous and irresponsible.</p>

<p>I feel like voting is important.  And I felt like I spent an appropriate amount of time learning about the candidates before going to vote.  I do, however, always feel like there is never a perfect fit for what I am looking for.   Herm ... :p</p>
