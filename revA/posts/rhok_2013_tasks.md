###Background###

[Random Hacks of Kindness](http://rhok.org/) 2013 is almost upon us!  I've taken some more time and chatted with a few people about my previous idea, outlined [here](http://timduffy.me/posts/rhok_idea.html).  The outline called for an infrastructure for facilitating and simplifying the transfer of perishable, but still good, food items between those who were going to throw them out (*suppliers*) and those who need them (*receivers*).  Below is a rough cut at a possible task list for the undertaking:

###Tasks###

 - **Come up with with a name**
   - Globally recognizable
   - Succinctly represents the goal of the project

 - **Design the container**
   - This task comes from an idea that [Brian Duffy](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/brian-duffy/46/268/381) has proposed.  He thought that it might be advantageous for certain *suppliers* to have a container outside of their facility rather than requiring them to keep donated items inside.  This also prevents them from staying open or staffing a location longer than they expected.  There also is the benefit for a representative from the *receivers* to be more flexible to when they arrive.
     - This also has a secondary benefit of 'brand recognition'.  By creating a recognizable container that a *supplier* would place outside of their location.  The goal is to have this be a similar effect as the UNICEF boxes.
     - Include some kind of scale for 'better stats'? Open Hardware?
       - Could also leverage existing relationships with scale manufactures at grocery store locations.

 - **Schedule meetings**
   - Schedule meetings with *suppliers*
     - Generate list of possible *suppliers*
       - Identify new vs existing donaters
       - For new donaters, create relationships
       - For existing donaters, optimize relationships
     - Schedule meeting(s) with management at a few local possible suppliers to pitch the idea.
     - Also, getting a better idea of company/corporate policies for donations will be necessary.
   - Schedule meetings with *receivers*
     - Schedule meeting(s) with possible *receivers*.
       - A list of food cupboards can be found [here](http://www3.libraryweb.org/uploadedFiles/MCLS/Central/Departments/Information_Center/Monroe%20County%20Area%20Food%20Cupboards%202013.pdf)
   - The short term goal is to have both receivers and suppliers lined up and committed for Sunday the 8th (the last day of RHoK)
   - Schedule meeting with representative at Penera Bread locally to better understand how their food donation system works (reference [link](https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/community/in-the-community.html))

 - **Define Website Functionality**
   - Define *receivers* side of site
     - Notification system?
   - Define *suppliers* side of site
     - Auto generate reports for taxes?
   - Define admin side of site
     - Lots to do here ...
   - Stats
     - It is going to important to generate statistics for all of this so both *receivers* and *suppliers* can work together to better their particular implementation of the system
     - Things like:
       - Did someone actually come to pick up food from the container?
       - Is the supplier actually donating, or do they just have the container outside their facility?
       - Did the food actually make it to a needy family?
       - etc. etc. etc. ...
       - Twitter feeds?
         - @timhortons: "we just fed 1024 people this month and saved 231 lbs of food from going to waist"
       - Facebook notifications? 
       - Awards to be presented to the *suppliers*?
 - **Define Mobile App Functionality**
   - Define *supplier* functions
     - Push notification of available pickup.  What details?
   - Define *receiver* functions
     - Get notification of available pickup and details.
