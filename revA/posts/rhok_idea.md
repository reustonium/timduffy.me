I was informed recently by [Remy DeCausemaker](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=32789361) that his application to run a local [Random Hacks of Kindness](http://www.rhok.org/) event for this years Global RHoK!

For those who are not familiar with RHoK, it is a global event that happens each year in December.  It is usually over a 72 hour period, where each location has a 24 hour(ish) hackathon to solve one (or several) problem within a big ol' list of problems posted to the website.

Here are two videos ( [YNN](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvsVycXHKlE), [13WHAM](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foF8KySIDbs) ) of Remy speaking about the event last year.  The event is where people can get together and try and solve rather large problems that can be seen around the world.

To attend the event you do not need to be a coder, or be tech savvy at all.  In many cases the coding part of the solution isn't the biggest part.  The problems that are being taken on can be absolutely massive.  Take a look at the [list](http://www.rhok.org/problems).

You can show up to the RHoK event with a problem already in mind, or just show up because you want to help out some great causes.  You can come with a team, or show up alone.  Remy is great at running hackathons (dare I say a specialty of his?), and everyone is welcome at them.

###Defining the Problem###

I decided this year that I would take some time to think about a problem that existed locally that I could try and solve.  There was a team last year that worked on a mobile website for NY State that assisted in the Hurricane Sandy relief effort - not extremely local, but it felt good to know that people Rochester, NY was helping those down state in their time of need.

I started thinking about some of the issues that exist within my local community, as well as other parts of Western and Upstate NY, and if they were solvable in a 24 hour period.  I came to the conclusion that the answer was probably 'no'.

Next I thought, well let's come up with a few requirements for my problem:

  - **Needs to be solved within 24 hours**
    - *Solved* in the wrong word to use here - I wanted to be able to lay a really strong ground work for getting to the solution.

  - **Needs to be done using the skills I already have**
    - Last year I showed up knowing little about the technologies I needed for the project that I was taking on (Monroe Minutes).  This was an amazing learning experience, but I did not get nearly as much as I wanted done.

  - **Needs to be useful enough, and easy enough to use that others will want to use it**
    - I want to make sure that if I'm putting in the effort, that it is easy to use and useful enough that others will want to use it.

  - **Needs to solve a problem that is local**
    - This does not, however, mean that it could not also be a problem that is a much wider issue.  My goal was to keep my scope reasonable, and if I was lucky enough to come up wit a solution that could be used other places then great!

  - **Needs to be *sexy* enough for others to want to help**
    - One thing I have seen a lot at hackathons is people coming up with absolutely AWESOME ideas for things they want to work on, but no one else does.  I think this is because the things they want to work on are either extremely niche, or are not exciting enough to the people at the event.  I want to come up with an idea that anyone could get behind.

Okay, those are my five requirements for my problem idea.  Great.  Awesome.  I'll just use those to come up with an idea...... I think I've got it.

###The Background###

There are, according to the the United States Census Bureau, about 50 million US Citizens living under the poverty line ( [reference](http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/about/overview/) ).  That is, in my mind, absolutely terrible.  The United States Federal Government for 2013, the poverty levels are just so incredibly low.  You can see them [here](http://www.familiesusa.org/resources/tools-for-advocates/guides/federal-poverty-guidelines.html).  For a family of four people, you must make less than $23,550 to me considered under the poverty line in the United States.

Assuming you get paid twice a month, that means you get paid 24 times a year.  Your pay check, before any deductions would be $1022.92 (rounded, yes I know).  Let's assume you are not self employed, and thus you pay 6.2% to Social Security and 1.45% to Medicare (based on 2013 [numbers](http://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/240)).  That is $1522.10 and $355.98 per year, reducing your pay check to $944.66 per paycheck (approximately every 15 days), resulting in $1,889/month.

Using the average-rent tool on [findthedata.org](http://average-rent.findthedata.org/), I filtered on the cheapest 2 bedroom apartment rent in New York state (note: I believe this is the average of the county, not the county that has the absolute cheapest).  The result was Chemung County, and $630/mo.  That brings our available money down to $1,259/mo.

Now, for some this may seem like a reasonable amount of money per month, and I don't disagree.  It is, however, an amount of money that would disappear quickly if you two children and a spouse to feed.  Also remember that the $22,550 that I based this on was the maximum amount that those 50,000,000 people could make - scary stuff.

###The Problem Statement###

> There are families and individuals that are, for one reason or another, unable to eat regular, nutritious meals all across the United States (and the world).

> There are also families, individuals, businesses, and government entities that, for one reason or another, are discarding or throwing away food that the aforementioned individuals and/or groups could be consuming.

Now, those two statements are, admittedly rather broad in their statements and
