There are a number of things that are apart of 'adult life' that are rather daunting - many of them legitimately.  There is one, however, that seems to have a rather dis-proportional level of confusion associated with it: Taxes.

Each year everyone who worked (on the books) within the United States of America is issued a W2 form (I believe the law says that it has to get to you before January 15th, but I think companies can file for extensions for various reasons).  You receive one W2 form for each job you worked within the year.  So if you worked at Target over the summer while you weren't in school, and then worked at Subway twice a week while you were in school, you would receive two W2 forms, one for each employer.  Each W2 has the amount of money the employeer paid you that year, as well as the amount of taxes you have already paid.

###How are Taxes Calculated###

The taxes that you pay to state and federal governments are based on your income from that year.  However, there is a instrument that those governments uses called a deduction.  A deduction reduces the taxable amount of money the government uses to calculate your taxes for the year.  So if you make $50,000 in 2013, but have deductions totaling $4,800, you would only be taxed on $41,200 for that year.  There are lots and lots of different types of deductions such as having children, being married, being a full time student, mortgage interest, student loan interest, etc.

There are a great number of different tax buckets that your money goes into, however it can, at the simplest level, be boiled down to two groups: State Taxes and Federal Taxes.

###Sate Taxes###

I live in NY State, so I will be using that as my guide.  NYS has a website [here](http://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/file/tax_tables.htm)
